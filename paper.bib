  abstract = {The cognitive radio is an emerging technology that enables dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks. The cognitive radio is capable of opportunistically using the available portions of a licensed spectrum to improve the application performance for unlicensed users. The opportunistic use of the available channels in the wireless environment requires dynamic channel assignment to efficiently utilize the available resources while minimizing the interference in the network. A challenging aspect of such algorithms is the incorporation of the channels' diverse characteristics, highly dynamic network conditions with respect to primary users' activity, and different fragmented sizes of the available channels. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks. We also classify the algorithms by presenting a thematic taxonomy of the current channel assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks. Moreover, the critical aspects of the current channel assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks are analyzed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of such algorithms. The similarities and differences of the algorithms based on the important parameters, such as routing dependencies, channel models, assignment methods, execution model, and optimization objectives, are also investigated. We also discuss open research issues and challenges of channel assignment in the cognitive radio networks.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio (CR) bands following an interference-free opportunistic manner. However, introduction of CR networks creates new challenges that are highly related to the fluctuation of TVWS, as they vary over time and location, as well as issues related to diverse Quality of Service requirements. In this context, this paper proposes two radio resource management (RRM) algorithms, enabling for the opportunistic exploitation of TVWS in a centralised CR networking architecture. Efficient administration of radio spectrum resources is achieved, by exploiting a novel RRM framework, adopted in a spectrum broker, which is in charge to effectively orchestrate the available wireless networking resources. Efficient RRM algorithms performance, as a matter of maximum-possible spectrum broker benefit and radio spectrum utilisation, as well as minimum-possible spectrum fragmentation is evaluated, by considering a fixed-price and an auction-based optimization approach. Experimental tests that were conducted under controlled simulation conditions, confirmed the validity of both RRM algorithms adopted in the proposed CR networking architecture, identifying fields for further research and experimentation.

abstract = {We present a cognitive radio (CR) mechanism for opportunistic access to the frequency bands licensed to a data-centric primary user (PU) network. Secondary users (SUs) aim to exploit the short-lived spectrum holes (or opportunities) created between packet bursts in the PU network. The PU traffic pattern changes over both time and frequency according to upper layer events in the PU network, and fast variation in PU activity may cause high sensing error probability and low spectrum utilization in dynamic spectrum access. The proposed mechanism learns a PU traffic pattern in real-time and uses the acquired information to access the frequency channel in an efficient way while limiting the probability of collision with the PUs below a target limit. To design the channel learning algorithm, we model the CR system as a hidden Markov model (HMM) and present a gradient method to find the underlying PU traffic pattern. We also analyze the identifiability of the proposed HMM to provide a condition for the convergence of the proposed learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm greatly outperforms the traditional listen-before-talk algorithm which does not possess any learning functionality.},

Following the discussion of interference temperature as a new metric for the quantification and management of interference, the paper addresses three fundamental cognitive tasks. 1) Radio-scene analysis. 2) Channel-state estimation and predictive modeling. 3) Transmit-power control and dynamic spectrum management.

abstract = {This paper investigates the optimal sensing order problem in multi-channel cognitive medium access control with opportunistic transmissions. The scenario in which the availability probability of each channel is known is considered first. In this case, when the potential channels are identical (except for the availability probabilities) and independent, it is shown that, although the intuitive sensing order (i.e., descending order of the channel availability probabilities) is optimal when adaptive modulation is not used, it does not lead to optimality in general with adaptive modulation. Thus, a dynamic programming approach to the search for an optimal sensing order with adaptive modulation is presented. For some special cases, it is proved that a simple optimal sensing order does exist. More complex scenarios are then considered, e.g., in which the availability probability of each channel is unknown. Optimal strategies are developed to address the challenges created by this additional uncertainty. Finally, a scheme is developed to address the issue of sensing errors.},

Limited by the hardware and environment, a secondary user may not be able to have ability to sense the entire spectrum space. Therefore, the POMDP is exploited to model the secondary network. In this paper, Q-Learning is applied to solve the POMDP because it can make full advantage of the past observation and decision experiences to optimize current action, and needs not transfer the POMDP into a belief MDP. The numeral simulation results show that Q-Learning-based decentralized cognitive MAC protocol improves the overall performance of the networks.},

abstract = {Cognitive radios (CRs) have been recently emerging as prime candidates to enhance spectral efficiency by exploiting spectrum-aware systems which can reliably monitor licensed users' activities. CR users monitor such activities by performing spectrum sensing to detect potential white spaces. However, this process of local sensing might be a challenging task in fading environments. The inefficiency of spectrum sensing might cause interference to licensees if they are miss-detected by CR users. Thus, cooperative spectrum sensing is proposed as a means to combat fading and improve the detection performance. However, the detection performance does not improve by such cooperation when low-SNR environment is considered. In this paper, cooperative spectrum sensing with PSO-based threshold adaptation is presented to address the aforementioned problem. Simulation results show that the detection performance with PSO-based adaptive detection threshold is improved, particularly, in low-SNR environment.},

Flexible spectrum use and cognitive radio technologies provide an approach to alleviating this problem by allowing for secondary spectrum use while the spectrum is underutilized by its primary licensed users. Idle spectrum is a time-frequency-location varying resource. It is a resource that also depends on the relative locations of the primary and secondary receivers and transmitters as well as the instantaneous propagation conditions. By acquiring awareness about the current radio environment and the other spectrum users, cognitive radios can more efficiently exploit idle spectrum and manage interference. Doing so requires a means to explore the spectrum to identify high-quality and persistent local spectral resources and access and share them among a number of users while strictly controlling the interference caused to others, in particular, licensed primary users (PUs). Situational awareness about the state of the spectrum allows for optimal exploitation of underutilized spectrum. For example, idle subbands may be allocated, and waveform parameters may be chosen to maximize the sum-rate for the cognitive users while making sure no harmful interference is caused to the other users of the spectrum.},

Doing so requires a means to explore the spectrum to identify high-quality and persistent local spectral resources and access and share them among a number of users while strictly controlling the interference caused to others, in particular, licensed primary users (PUs). Situational awareness about the state of the spectrum allows for optimal exploitation of underutilized spectrum. For example, idle subbands may be allocated, and waveform parameters may be chosen to maximize the sum-rate for the cognitive users while making sure no harmful interference is caused to the other users of the spectrum.},

abstract = {In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the design of an optimal spectrum sensing scheme is an important problem that has recently been drawing consideration attention. Various sensing-related performance tradeoffs have been studied as an efficient means to maximize the secondary network performance. Despite its importance, however, the sensing-access tradeoff-between sensing overhead and the MAC-layer contention among secondary users in accessing the thus-discovered spectrum opportunities-has not yet been accounted for. In this paper, we show that the secondary network throughput can be improved significantly by incorporating the sensing-access tradeoff in the design of spectrum sensing. We first introduce a new concept of ({\^{A}}¿, {\~{A}} )-contention spectrum sharing and analyze the sensing requirement to meet a certain channel contention constraint by using the improper list-coloring in graph theory. Specifically, we derive the relationship among the sensing requirements, the secondary network density, and the transmission power of secondary users. To maximize the network throughput, we propose a distributed spectrum-sharing algorithm, called Smart Share, which exploits channel contention and heterogeneous channel conditions to maximize the secondary network throughput. We also describe how to realize Smart Share in an 802.11 MAC protocol for its practical use and evaluation. Our simulation-based evaluation shows that, sensing an optimal number of channels for given network density can improve the achievable throughput of SmartShare by up to 60{\%} over a single-channel sensing strategy.},

abstract = {We propose decentralized cognitive MAC protocols that allow secondary users to independently search for spectrum opportunities without a central coordinator or a dedicated communication channel. Recognizing hardware and energy constraints, we assume that a secondary user may not be able to perform full-spectrum sensing or may not be willing to monitor the spectrum when it has no data to transmit. We develop an analytical framework for opportunistic spectrum access based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This decision-theoretic approach integrates the design of spectrum access protocols at the MAC layer with spectrum sensing at the physical layer and traffic statistics determined by the application layer of the primary network. It also allows easy incorporation of spectrum sensing error and constraint on the probability of colliding with the primary users. Under this POMDP framework, we propose cognitive MAC protocols that optimize the performance of secondary users while limiting the interference perceived by primary users. A suboptimal strategy with reduced complexity yet comparable performance is developed. Without additional control message exchange between the secondary transmitter and receiver, the proposed decentralized protocols ensure synchronous hopping in the spectrum between the transmitter and the receiver in the presence of collisions and spectrum sensing errors},
